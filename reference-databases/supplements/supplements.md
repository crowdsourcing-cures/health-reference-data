# Dietary Supplement Label Database

The Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) includes full label derived information from dietary supplement products marketed in the U.S.

# Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database 

This doesn't have data for branded products.  Maybe just use Dietary Supplement Label Database?

These data are appropriate for use in population studies of nutrient intake rather than for assessing content of individual products.
