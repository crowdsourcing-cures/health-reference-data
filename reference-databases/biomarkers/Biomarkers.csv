blood_analysis,,laboratory,Blood Analysis,,,"A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a hypodermic needle, or via fingerprick. Multiple tests for specific blood components, such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test, are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work. Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count. Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test,
urine_analysis,,laboratory,Urine Analysis,,,"Urinalysis tests are  examinations of the physical and chemical properties of urine and its microscopic appearance to aid in medical diagnosis. They involve assessment of the physical properties of urine, such as color and clarity; chemical analysis using a urine test strip; and microscopic examination.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_urine_tests,
saliva_analysis,,laboratory,Saliva Analysis,,,"Saliva testing or Salivaomics is a diagnostic technique that involves laboratory analysis of saliva to identify markers of endocrine, immunologic, inflammatory, infectious, and other types of conditions. Saliva is a useful biological fluid for assaying steroid hormones such as cortisol, genetic material like RNA, proteins such as enzymes and antibodies, and a variety of other substances, including natural metabolites, including saliva nitrite, a biomarker for nitric oxide status (see below for Cardiovascular Disease, Nitric Oxide: a salivary biomarker for cardio-protection). Saliva testing is used to screen for or diagnose numerous conditions and disease states, including Cushing's disease, anovulation, HIV, cancer, parasites, hypogonadism, and allergies. Salivary testing has even been used by the U.S. government to assess circadian rhythm shifts in astronauts before flight and to evaluate hormonal profiles of soldiers undergoing military survival training.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva_testing,
stool_analysis,,laboratory,Stool Analysis,,,"A stool test involves the collection and analysis of fecal matter to diagnose the presence or absence of a medical condition. Fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test are the most common stool tests to diagnose many conditions that caused by bleeding in the gastrointestinal system, including colorectal cancer or stomach cancer.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stool_test,

Compared to the arm, lower blood pressure in the leg suggests blocked arteries due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). The ABPI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle by the systolic blood pressure in the arm",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle_brachial_pressure_index,

It represents the force that the heart generates each time it contracts.

This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W⁄H). For example, a person with a 30″ (76 cm) waist and 38″ (97 cm) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.78. The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, fertility, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. WHR correlates with perceptions of physical attractiveness.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist-hip_ratio,
