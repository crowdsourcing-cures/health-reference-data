mass_spectrometry,Mass spectrometry,5.0,clinical,"Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.
The results are typically presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.
Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry,blood_analysis,,,,,,,
ppg,Photoplethysmography (PPG),0.1,clinical,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical measurement method that is often used for heart rate monitoring purposes.

blood_glucose_fingerstick,Blood glucose monitoring with a Fingerstick,1.0,clinical,"In medicine, some blood tests are conducted on capillary blood obtained by fingerstick (or fingerprick).
The site, free of surface arterial flow, where the blood is to be collected is sterilized with a topical germicide,
and the skin pierced with a sterile lancet. After a droplet has formed, capillary blood is captured in a capillary tube (usually relying on surface tension).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerstick,blood_glucose,,,,,,,
cgm,Continuous glucose monitor (CGM),1.0,clinical,"A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a device used for monitoring blood glucose on a continual basis. A continuous glucose monitor
takes a reading on set intervals with a small electrode placed under the skin and held in place by an adhesive.
A transmitter attached to the electrode sends data to a separate receiver.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor,blood_glucose,,,,,,,
ecg,Electrocardiography,0.5,clinical,"Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG[a]). It is a graph of voltage versus time of the
electrical activity of the heart[4] using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a
consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography,heart_rate,heart_rate_variability,,,,,,
urine_test_stripe,Urin ph test stripe diagnostic (Urinalysis),5.0,clinical,"A urine test strip or dipstick is a basic diagnostic tool used to determine pathological changes in a patient's urine in standard urinalysis.
A standard urine test strip may comprise up to 10 different chemical pads or reagents which react (change color) when immersed in, and then removed from,
a urine sample. The test can often be read in as little as 60 to 120 seconds after dipping, although certain tests require longer.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_test_strip,urine_analysis,,,,,,,

gene_sequencing,Genomic sequencing,0.1,clinical,"Whole genome sequencing is ostensibly the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time.
This entails sequencing all of an organism's chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and, for plants, in the chloroplast.
In practice, genome sequences that are nearly complete are also called whole genome sequences.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing,,,,,,,,
